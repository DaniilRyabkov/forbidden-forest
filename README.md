> This is the displacement of a close object relative to a distant one when the viewing angle changes. Thanks to this effect, we see objects in volume, perceive depth and understand what is closer and what is further. On websites, the image is flat, and the designer can only create the illusion of volume. The parallax effect can help with this.
